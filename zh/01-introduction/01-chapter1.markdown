# 起步 #

本章介绍开始使用 Git 前的相关知识。我们会先了解一些版本控制工具的历史背景，然后试着在你的系统上把 Git 跑起来，直到最后配置好，可以开始正常的开发工作。读完本章，你就会理解为什么 Git 会如此流行，为什么你真的需要使用它。

## 关于版本控制 ##

什么是版本控制？我真的需要吗？版本控制是一种记录若干文件内容变化，以便将来查阅特定版本修订情况的系统。在本书所展示的例子中，我们仅对保存着软件源代码的文本文件作版本控制管理，而实际上，你可以对任何类型的文件进行版本控制。

如果你是位图形或网页设计师，可能会需要保存某一幅图片或页面布局文件的所有修订版本。采用版本控制系统（VCS）是个明智的选择。有了它你就可以将某个文件回溯到之前的状态，甚至将整个项目都回退到过去某个时间点的状态。你可以比较文件的变化细节，查出是谁最后修改了什么地方从而造成某些怪异问题，又是谁在何时报告了某个功能缺陷，等等。使用版本控制系统通常还意味着，就算你胡来搞砸了整个项目，把文件改的改，删的删，你也可以轻松恢复到原先的样子。而由此额外增加的工作量却微乎其微。

### 本地版本控制系统 ###

许多人习惯用复制整个项目目录的方式来保存不同的版本，或许还会改名加上备份时间以示区别。这么做唯一的好处就是简单，不过坏处却不少：有时候会混淆所在的工作目录，弄错了文件丢了数据就没了后退的路。

为了解决这个问题，人们很久以前就开发了许多种本地版本控制系统，大多都是采用某种简单的数据库来记录文件的历次更新差异（见图 1-1）。

Figure 1-1. Local version control diagram

其中最流行的一种叫做 rcs，现今许多计算机系统上都还看得到它的踪影。甚至在流行的 Mac OS X 系统上安装了开发者工具包之后，也可以使用 rcs 命令。它的工作原理基本上就是保存并管理文件补丁（patch）。文件补丁是一种特定格式的文本文件，记录着对应文件修订前后的内容变化。所以，根据每次修订后的补丁，rcs 可以通过不断打补丁，计算出各个版本的文件内容。

### 集中化的版本控制系统 ###

接下来人们又遇到一个问题，如何让在不同系统上的开发者协同工作？于是，集中化的版本控制系统（ Centralized Version Control Systems，简称 CVCS ）应运而生。这类系统，诸如 CVS，Subversion 以及 Perforce 等，都有一个单一的集中管理的服务器，保存所有文件的修订版本，而协同工作的人们都通过客户端连到这台服务器，取出最新的文件或者提交更新。多年以来，这已成为版本控制系统的标准做法（见图 1-2）。

Insert 18333fig0102.png 
Figure 1-2. Centralized version control diagram

这种做法带来了许多好处，特别是相较于老式的本地 VCS 来说。现在，每个人都可以一定程度上看到项目中的其他人正在做些什么。而管理员也可以轻松掌控每个开发者的权限，并且管理一个 CVCS 要远比在各个客户端上维护本地数据库轻松容易得多。

事分两面，有好有坏。这么做最显而易见的缺点是中央服务器的单点故障。若是宕机一小时，那么在这一小时内，谁都无法提交更新，也就无法协同工作。如果中央服务器的磁盘发生故障，并且没做过备份或者备份得不够及时的话，还会有丢失数据的风险。最坏的情况是彻底丢失整个项目的所有历史更改记录，被客户端提取出来的某些快照数据除外，但这样的话依然是个问题，你不能保证所有的数据都已经有人提取出来。本地版本控制系统也存在类似问题，只要整个项目的历史记录被保存在单一位置，就有丢失所有历史更新信息的风险。

### 分布式版本控制系统 ###

于是分布式版本控制系统（ Distributed Version Control System，简称 DVCS ）面世了。在这类系统中，诸如 Git，Mercurial，Bazaar 还有 Darcs 等，客户端并不只提取最新版本的文件快照，而是把原始的代码仓库完整地镜像下来。这么一来，任何一处协同工作用的服务器发生故障，事后都可以用任何一个镜像出来的本地仓库恢复。因为每一次的提取操作，实际上都是一次对代码仓库的完整备份（见图 1-3）。

Insert 18333fig0103.png 
Figure 1-3. Distributed version control diagram

更进一步，许多这类系统都可以指定和若干不同的远端代码仓库进行交互。籍此，你就可以在同一个项目中，分别和不同工作小组的人相互协作。你可以根据需要设定不同的协作流程，比方说层次模型式的工作流，这在以前的集中式系统中是无法实现的。

## Git 的历史 ##

同生活中的许多伟大事件一样，Git 诞生于一个极富纷争大举创新的年代。Linux 内核开源项目有着为数众广的参与者。绝大多数的  Linux 内核维护工作都花在了提交补丁和保存归档的繁琐事务上（1991－2002年间）。到 2002 年，整个项目组开始启用分布式版本控制系统 BitKeeper 来管理和维护代码。

到 2005 年的时候，开发 BitKeeper 的商业公司同 Linux 内核开源社区的合作关系结束，他们收回了免费使用 BitKeeper 的权力。这就迫使 Linux 开源社区（特别是 Linux 的缔造者 Linus Torvalds ）不得不吸取教训，只有开发一套属于自己的版本控制系统才不至于重蹈覆辙。他们对新的系统订了若干目标：

*	速度
*	简单的设计
*	对非线性开发模式的强力支持（允许上千个并行开发的分支）
*	完全分布式
*	有能力高效管理类似 Linux 内核一样的超大规模项目（速度和数据量）

自诞生于 2005 年以来，Git 日臻成熟完善，在高度易用的同时，仍然保留着初期设定的目标。它的速度飞快，极其适合管理大项目，它还有着令人难以置信的非线性分支管理系统（见第三章），可以应付各种复杂的项目开发需求。

## Git 基础要点 ##

So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as Subversion and Perforce; doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Git stores and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar; understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it.

### Snapshots, Not Differences ###

The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time, as illustrated in Figure 1-4.

Insert 18333fig0104.png 
Figure 1-4. Other systems tend to store data as changes to a base version of each file.

Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again—just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like Figure 1-5. 

Insert 18333fig0105.png 
Figure 1-5. Git stores data as snapshots of the project over time.

This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs. It makes Git reconsider almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from the previous generation. This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS. We’ll explore some of the benefits you gain by thinking of your data this way when we cover Git branching in Chapter 3.

### Nearly Every Operation Is Local ###

Most operations in Git only need local files and resources to operate – generally no information is needed from another computer on your network.  If you’re used to a CVCS where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers. Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.

For example, to browse the history of the project, Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you—it simply reads it directly from your local database. This means you see the project history almost instantly. If you want to see the changes introduced between the current version of a file and the file a month ago, Git can look up the file a month ago and do a local difference calculation, instead of having to either ask a remote server to do it or pull an older version of the file from the remote server to do it locally.

This also means that there is very little you can’t do if you’re offline or off VPN. If you get on an airplane or a train and want to do a little work, you can commit happily until you get to a network connection to upload. If you go home and can’t get your VPN client working properly, you can still work. In many other systems, doing so is either impossible or painful. In Perforce, for example, you can’t do much when you aren’t connected to the server; and in Subversion and CVS, you can edit files, but you can’t commit changes to your database (because your database is offline). This may not seem like a huge deal, but you may be surprised what a big difference it can make.

### Git Has Integrity ###

Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.

The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA-1 hash. This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git. A SHA-1 hash looks something like this:

	24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373

You will see these hash values all over the place in Git because it uses them so much. In fact, Git stores everything not by file name but in the Git database addressable by the hash value of its contents.

### Git Generally Only Adds Data ###

When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is very difficult to get the system to do anything that is undoable or make it erase data in any way. As in any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you haven’t committed yet; but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository.

This makes using Git a joy because we know we can experiment without the danger of severely screwing things up. For a more in-depth look at how Git stores its data and how you can recover data that seems lost, see “Under the Covers” in Chapter 9.

### The Three States ###

Now, pay attention. This is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area.

Insert 18333fig0106.png 
Figure 1-6. Working directory, staging area, and git directory

The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.

The basic Git workflow goes something like this:

1.	You modify files in your working directory.
2.	You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.
3.	You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.

If a particular version of a file is in the git directory, it’t considered committed. If it’s modified but has been added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified. In Chapter 2, you’ll learn more about these states and how you can either take advantage of them or skip the staged part entirely.

## 安装 Git ##

Let’s get into using some Git. First things first—you have to install it. You can get it a number of ways; the two major ones are to install it from source or to install an existing package for your platform.

### 从源代码安装 ###

If you can, it’s generally useful to install Git from source, because you’ll get the most recent version. Each version of Git tends to include useful UI enhancements, so getting the latest version is often the best route if you feel comfortable compiling software from source. It is also the case that many Linux distributions contain very old packages; so unless you’re on a very up-to-date distro or are using backports, installing from source may be the best bet.

To install Git, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends on: curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv. For example, if you’re on a system that has yum (such as Fedora) or apt-get (such as a Debian based system), you can use one of these commands to install all of the dependencies:

	$ yum install curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
	  openssl-devel zlib-devel

	$ apt-get install curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
	  openssl-devel zlib-devel
	
When you have all the necessary dependencies, you can go ahead and grab the latest snapshot from the Git web site:

	http://git-scm.com/download
	
Then, compile and install:

	$ tar -zxf git-1.6.0.5.tar.gz
	$ cd git-1.6.0.5
	$ make prefix=/usr/local all
	$ sudo make prefix=/usr/local install

After this is done, you can also get Git via Git itself for updates:

	$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
	
### 在 Linux 上安装 ###

If you want to install Git on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora, you can use yum:

	$ yum install git-core

Or if you’re on a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, try apt-get:

	$ apt-get instal git-core

### 在 Mac 上安装 ###

There are two easy ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is to use the graphical Git installer, which you can download from the Google Code page (see Figure 1-7):

http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer

Insert 18333fig0107.png 
Figure 1-7. Git OS X installer

The other major way is to install Git via MacPorts (http://www.macports.org). If you have MacPorts installed, install Git via

	$ sudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb

You don’t have to add all the extras, but you’ll probably want to include +svn in case you ever have to use Git with Subversion repositories (see Chapter 8).

### 在 Windows 上安装 ###

Installing Git on Windows is very easy. The msysGit project has one of the easier installation procedures. Simply download the installer exe file from the Google Code page, and run it:

	http://code.google.com/p/msysgit

After it’s installed, you have both a command-line version (including an SSH client that will come in handy later) and the standard GUI.

## 首次运行 Git 时的配置 ##

Now that you have Git on your system, you’ll want to do a few things to customize your Git environment. You should have to do these things only once; they’ll stick around between upgrades. You can also change them at any time by running through the commands again.

Git comes with a tool called git config that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:

*	`/etc/gitconfig` file: Contains values for every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option` --system` to `git config`, it reads and writes from this file specifically. 
*	`~/.gitconfig` file: Specific to your user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the `--global` option. 
*	config file in the git directory (that is, `.git/config`) of whatever repository you’re currently using: Specific to that single repository. Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in `.git/config` trump those in `/etc/sysconfig`.

On Windows systems, Git looks for the `.gitconfig` file in the `$HOME` directory (C:\Documents and Settings\$USER for most people). It also still looks for /etc/gitconfig, although it’s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer.

### 个人身份标识 ###

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and e-mail address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you pass around:

	$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
	$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the `--global` option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or e-mail address for specific projects, you can run the command without the `--global` option when you’re in that project.

### 编辑器 ###

Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. By default, Git uses your system’s default editor, which is generally Vi or Vim. If you want to use a different text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:

	$ git config --global core.editor emacs
	
### 差异分析工具 ###

Another useful option you may want to configure is the default diff tool to use to resolve merge conflicts. Say you want to use vimdiff:

	$ git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

Git accepts kdiff3, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, and opendiff as valid merge tools. You can also set up a custom tool; see Chapter 7 for more information about doing that.

### 查看你的配置信息 ###

If you want to check your settings, you can use the `git config --list` command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

	$ git config --list
	user.name=Scott Chacon
	user.email=schacon@gmail.com
	color.status=auto
	color.branch=auto
	color.interactive=auto
	color.diff=auto
	...

You may see keys more than once, because Git reads the same key from different files (`/etc/gitconfig` and `~/.gitconfig`, for example). In this case, Git uses the last value for each unique key it sees.

You can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing `git config {key}`:

	$ git config user.name
	Scott Chacon

## 获取帮助 ##

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

	$ git help <verb>
	$ git <verb> --help
	$ man git-<verb>

For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running

	$ git help config

These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline.
If the manpages and this book aren’t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the `#git` or `#github` channel on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.

## 小结 ##

You should have a basic understanding of what Git is and how it’s different from the CVCS you may have been using. You should also now have a working version of Git on your system that’s set up with your personal identity. It’s now time to learn some Git basics.
