PDF Version of Pro Git
======================

This directory contains the tools necessary for generating a PDF version of
Pro Git by converting script for converting the contents of the book into
LaTeX. You'll need to have pandoc and xetex installed for this to work.

* `makepdf` - this does everything to generate the PDF in one go. Just run
  `./makepdf` and it'll make you a `progit.en.pdf`. It uses `pandoc` to
  convert the Markdown into LaTeX, and XeTeX to make the PDF.
* `main.tex` - this is the main LaTeX file that defines all the macros, etc.
  used by the content. Edit this if you want to change the style of the fonts,
  diagrams, headers/footers, etc.
